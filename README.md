# Data Scraper: Extracting Dynamic Flipkart Data, Static Interview Insights, and Table Data from Wikipedia and Shark Tank

This project is a data scraper that extracts dynamic data from Flipkart, static data from interview websites, and table data from Wikipedia and Shark Tank. The scraper is designed to extract different types of data from various sources, highlighting the flexibility and versatility of the tool.

For Flipkart, the scraper extracts dynamic data such as product details, pricing, and availability. This is achieved by simulating user interactions with the website and extracting the relevant data using web scraping techniques.

For interview websites, the scraper extracts static data such as interview questions, answers, and tips. This is achieved by scraping the HTML content of the website and extracting the relevant data using regular expressions and other text processing techniques.

For Wikipedia and Shark Tank, the scraper extracts structured data from tables. This is achieved by parsing the HTML content of the website and extracting the table data using libraries such as Beautiful Soup or Pandas.

The scraper is built using Python and various libraries such as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas. The scraped data is stored in a database or a CSV file for further analysis or visualization.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of web scraping in extracting valuable data from various sources, which can be used for a variety of purposes such as market research, data analysis, and decision making.
